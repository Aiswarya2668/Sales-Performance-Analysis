## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Technology** and **Office Supplies** are the main profit drivers, contributing over 90% of total profit (£230,073 out of £247,961), while **Furniture** consistently underperforms across all years—indicating that future growth should focus on Technology and Office Supplies rather than Furniture.
- Sales are highly concentrated in a few sub-categories—**Phones and Chairs** alone generate nearly 29% of total sales (£556,523 out of £1,928,888)—indicating that focusing pricing, promotions, and inventory on these top sub-categories can significantly impact overall revenue.
- Customer count peaked in **2023** (638 customers) before dropping sharply in 2024 (513), suggesting potential customer churn or reduced acquisition in 2024 that may require targeted retention or marketing strategies.
- **California** dominates the market, generating £390,146, which is over 20% of total sales (£1,928,888). In fact, the top three states **California, New York, and Texas** together account for nearly 41% of total sales, indicating a heavy concentration of revenue in a few key regions.
- Sales are highly seasonal, with the highest revenue in **November (£234,013) and December (£241,464)** together contributing nearly 25% of annual sales. In contrast, February (£59,640) and January (£94,925) are the slowest months, showing a significant drop at the start of the year. This suggests strong year-end demand, likely influenced by holidays or seasonal promotions.



### Overall Key Takeaways

- **Profit Drivers**: Technology & Office Supplies dominate profits; Furniture underperforms. 
- **Top Products**: Phones & Chairs generate ~29% of total sales—focus on these for growth.  
- **Customer Trends**: Peak in 2023; drop in 2024 indicates possible churn or lower acquisition.
